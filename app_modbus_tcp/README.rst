Modbus TCP GPIO Demo Application
================================

:scope: Example
:description: Demonstrates Modbus slave with GPIO slice card
:keywords: ModbusTCP
:boards: XA-SK-E100, XA-SK-GPIO

A demonstration application in which the Modbus TCP Server Component is used with the XA-SK-E100 and XA-SK-GPIO Slice Cards together  to receive commands from a the SimplyModbus(TM) Software running on a Windows PC over TCP. The commands can be issued to:

   * Turn GPIO Slice Card LEDS on and off
   * Read the room temperature via the on-board ADC
   * Display GPIO Slice Card button presses
