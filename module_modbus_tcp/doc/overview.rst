Overview========This component is a Modbus Slave that receives Modbus TCP commands from a Modbus master acting as a TCP client. It requests appropriate device data from the application. Finally, it generates Modbus TCP responses and sends to the Modbus master over TCP. The Modbus TCP component has in-built Ethernet and TCP server components. Note that this code is not suitable for use as a master.The following Modbus TCP commands are supported:   - Read Coils   - Write Single Coil   - Read Input Register   - Read Holding Registers   - Write Single Register   - Read Discrete Inputs
