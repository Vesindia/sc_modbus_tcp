The *Modbus TCP Function Library* can be installed via the xSOFTip browser in the xTIMEcomposer or downloaded via http://www.xmos.com.

Demo applications

A Demo application is supplied with the library that implements a webserver to get Modbus TCP commands from a Host Modbus master application (SimplyModbus for PC, in this case) and uses a ``XA-SK-GPIO`` slice card to imitate Coils and Registers. It is available in the xSOFTip browser:
