Programming Guide=================Installing the component------------------------The *Modbus TCP Slave* component can be installed via the xSOFTip browser in the xTIMEcomposer or downloaded via http://www.xmos.com.Using the Module----------------To use the module you need to add ``module_modbus_tcp`` to the ``USED_MODULES`` variable in your application Makefile.*Files*``modbus_tcp.h``   Include this file in your application to run the Modbus TCP Server on a logical core.``modbus_tcp_conf.h``   Have this file in your application and set the configuration defines as described in the :ref:`modbus_tcp_api` section.*Ports*The application must define ports to use for Ethernet slice. Ethernet ports can be defined as (sample)::    ethernet_xtcp_ports_t xtcp_ports =   {     on tile[1]: OTP_PORTS_INITIALIZER,                 ETHERNET_DEFAULT_SMI_INIT,                 ETHERNET_DEFAULT_MII_INIT_lite,                 ETHERNET_DEFAULT_RESET_INTERFACE_INIT   };  *Variables*Application must define the IP configuration to use for the TCP Server that ``module_modbus_tcp`` is going to implement. If the user wants an IP configuration to be dynamically assigned on the network then this variable can be set to all 0s. For example:For static IP::      xtcp_ipconfig_t ipconfig = {     { 169, 254, 231, 27 },     { 255, 255, 0, 0 },     { 0, 0, 0, 0 }   };For DHCP::      xtcp_ipconfig_t ipconfig = {     { 0, 0, 0, 0 },     { 0, 0, 0, 0 },     { 0, 0, 0, 0 }   };   Demo applications-----------------A Demo application is supplied with the component that implements an application to get Modbus TCP commands from a Host Modbus master application (SimplyModbus for PC) and uses a ``XA-SK-GPIO`` slice card to:- Turn GPIO Slice Card LEDS on and off- Read the room temperature via the on-board ADC- Display GPIO Slice Card button pressesIt is available in the xSOFTip browser as:- Modbus TCP Demo: Please read the Modbus TCP Demo Quickstart Guide for further infomration on using this demo.
